###What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
**Get** requests data from a resource. Get requests can be cached, bookmarked, stay in browser history, have length 
restrictions, should not be used when dealing with sensitive data, and should only be used to retrieve data.
**Post** submits data to be processed to a resource. Post requests are never cached, do not stay in the browser
history, can't be bookmarked, don't have restrictions on data length.

###What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in the browser of the user. This helps the 
websites remember information about the user or their browsing activity.
