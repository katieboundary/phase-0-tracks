###What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
Linux is an open source software. It is a modular unix like operating system. It uses the Linux kernel to 
handle process control, networking, and access to files. kernel is the core of the system and manages the 
CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The bootloader is the software that manages the boot process of your computer. 
Daemons are background services that run when you log into your computer. The shell is the command line. The 
graphical server displays graphics on your monitor. The desktop environment is what the user interacts with and there
are several to choose from. Applications can also be added to the linux environment. There is no cost to use linux 
many feel it is more dependable than other operating systems. Some of the philosophies of open source include: 
*The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
*The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
*The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
*The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

###In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A VPS is a machine sold as a service by an internet hosting service for someone to use remotely. 
The advantages include being cheaper than buying the physical server, they are easy to create, easy to destroy,
they can run the same software as a dedicated server, and there are less consequences if a mistake is made.

###Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
It is good practice to run your applications on a user level and leave administrative tasks to the root user. 
It is less secure to run programs as the root user. If a mistake is made on the user lever (instead of root) it
is less likely to create problems with the underlying system.
