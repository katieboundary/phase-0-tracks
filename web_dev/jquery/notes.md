I plan to research jquery by looking up the API documentation, find cheat sheets, watch tutorials, 
find introductory articles and find a book for further research.

I found some helpful tutuorials and breakdowns of what jquery is.

Watching somebody live code jquery was also helpful to provide a visual of their workflow.
