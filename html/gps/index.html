	<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
		-Semantic tags provide meaning to HTML so that browsers can properly render the document, so other coders can interpret
		your code, and it makes the document more accessable to people with disabilities. <nav> is a really helpful element that 
		allows you to easily move from one page to another.

		What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
		-HTML is interpreted by the browser in the order it is written. So the body of this document will be rendered, then the
		contents inside the body starting with our <H1>Table!</H1>, then our header, and so on.
	
		What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
		-I learned how to make a snippet and therefore improve my sublime workflow. I think I'll make more snippets, but I'll
		have to do some more research and see, as time goes on, what I find myself typing the most.
	
		What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
		-There are still a few more elements like <aside> and <article> that I only have a vague understanding of. I'm sure
		working with them in a project and reviewing code from other sites will help give me a good visual of how and why 
		they are used.-->
