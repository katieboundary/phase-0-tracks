##Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a tool that helps manage changes to source code over time. It's helpful since it includes the entire history of revisions of files or merge revisions made by multiple people. Version control allows branching and merging for teams to collaborate on a project without interfering though it's helpful for solo projects too. It also allows you to trace everything that has been done and leave a message about why a change was made.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch produces a copy of the code for you to work on. It's helpful for teams to work on separate portions and then be reviewed before merging with the master branch and ensure that there aren't conflicts. It helps keep multiple streams of work separate so it's helpful for solo projects too. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in Git that also creates a unique ID. After making a change it's important to save the work by making a commit and leaving a detailed message describing what was done and or why. It's good to capitalize the subject line and a period is not needed at the end.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict can occur when two or more people are working on the same file and make different changes to the same line.
